It involves writing all modified data pages (dirty pages) from\nthe shared buffer cache to the disk, as well as updating the write-ahead log\n(WAL) to reflect these changes. Checkpoints help minimize recovery time in case\nof a crash by reducing the amount of WAL that needs to be replayed.\nBut defaults are conservative, and checkpoints may occur more frequently than\nnecessary for your workload. Frequent checkpoints can lead to increased I/O\nactivity, which may impact performance. By tuning checkpoint settings, you can\noptimize the balance between data durability and system performance.\nChange the checkpoint_timeout to a longer duration, for example:\n\nOptional settings to consider:\n\nRelationship between wal_segment_size and max_wal_size&nbsp;\nwal_segment_size → the size of a single WAL file on disk.\nmax_wal_size → the target maximum total WAL space before a checkpoint triggers.\nFor example if wal_segment_size is 16MB and max_wal_size is 1GB, then a\ncheckpoint will be triggered after approximately 64 WAL files (1GB / 16MB) have\nbeen generated.\nif wal_segment_size is increased, for example to 64MB, and max_wal_size\nremains at 1GB, then a checkpoint will be triggered after approximately 16 WAL\nfiles (1GB / 64MB) have been generated.\nThis means that with a larger wal_segment_size, checkpoints may occur less\nfrequently in terms of the number of WAL files, but the total amount of WAL\ndata written before a checkpoint remains the same as defined by max_wal_size.\nWhere the WAL files are stored&nbsp;\nWAL files are stored in the pg_wal directory within the PostgreSQL data:\n\nlist the files in the pg_wal directory:\n\nEven with a long checkpoint_timeout, PostgreSQL may still trigger a checkpoint if WAL reaches max_wal_size, example:\n\nYou'll see ~4 WAL files fill up before a checkpoint is forced (4 × 64 MB = 256 MB).\nTest
